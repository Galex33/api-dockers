# Rihanna Estimator 

This web-app allows you to estimate the price of a diamond. Fill in the form and get the estimated price of your diamond. 

The predictive model (*DecisionTreeRegressor*) is based on several features : 
* **carat** : weight of the diamond *(0.2 to 5.01)*
* **cut** : quality of the cut *(Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)*
* **color** : diamond color *(J [worst] to D [best])*
* **clarity** : measurement of how clear the diamond is *(I1 [worst], SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF [best])*
* **x** : length in mm *(0 to 10.74)*
* **y** : width in mm *(0 to 58.9)*
* **z** : depth in mm 	*(0 to 31.8)*
* **depth** : total depth percentage *(43 to 79)*
* **table** :width of top of diamond relative to widest point
